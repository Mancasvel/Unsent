Video 5 – “The Digital Cremation”

Hook:
Some memories need more than a delete button. They need a funeral.

Body:
In Unsent, when a conversation has served its purpose, you don't just archive it. You can perform a ritual. A digital cremation.

I added this because letting go is an act of intention. It’s a ceremony. With a tap, you can watch the words that held so much weight turn to digital embers and float away.

It’s a way of telling yourself, and the system, that you’re ready to move on. It’s not about forgetting. It’s about choosing what to release.

Final punch:
You can't burn the past. But you can burn the pain.

And that’s how you find peace.
