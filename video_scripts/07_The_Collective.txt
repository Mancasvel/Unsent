Video 7 – “Fragments from Strangers”

Hook:
You think you’re the only one who feels this way. You’re not.

Body:
The most isolating part of pain is thinking it’s yours alone. That’s why Unsent has a collective layer.

As you navigate your own journey, you’ll find fragments. Short, anonymous messages left by other users who were in the same emotional territory.

It’s not a social network. There are no profiles, no likes. It’s just a quiet reminder that someone else has stood where you’re standing now. A whisper from a stranger that says, "I get it."

Final punch:
Your pain is unique. But your journey is universal.

You are not alone in the silence.
