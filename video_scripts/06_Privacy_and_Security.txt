Video 6 – “Why It’s Encrypted”

Hook:
If your most personal thoughts live in an app, it better treat them like sacred ground.

Body:
In Unsent, everything you write is encrypted. Not for compliance — for dignity.

I’m using MongoDB Atlas with full end-to-end encryption. Even if someone got access, all they’d find is silence and static.

Because these aren’t just messages. They’re memories. Ghosts. Regrets. Confessions. Some people write to the dead. Others to lovers they’ll never see again.

And I won’t let anyone — not even me — see what they wrote.

Final punch:
The app forgets. So you can remember safely.

That’s privacy as reverence.
