Video 2 – “The Map of Healing”

Hook:
Grief isn't a bug. It's a journey with a map.

Body:
When I was building Unsent, I knew it couldn't just be a blank page. That's not how healing works. It's a process, a path through different emotional territories.

That's why I structured it around the five stages: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. It’s a psychological atlas.

The app doesn't judge you for being lost in the fog of Denial or burning in the fires of Anger. It just shows you where you are. It helps you see the path forward, to the bedrock of Acceptance, where the weight you carry finally becomes part of the landscape.

Final punch:
You can't escape the storm. But you can learn to navigate it.

This is your compass.
