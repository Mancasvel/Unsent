Video 1 – “The Words We Keep”

Hook:
We all have a graveyard of words inside us.

Body:
Think about it. The messages you typed out, read a dozen times, and then deleted. The things you should have said, could have said, but didn't. Where do they go?

I built Unsent because I believe they don't just vanish. They become ghosts that haunt us.

This app isn't a messaging service. It's a digital seance. A place to speak to those ghosts, to give them form, to see what they're trying to tell you. It’s a space to excavate the ruins of your own silence.

Final punch:
Because the heaviest things we carry are the words we never said.

Unsent is where you finally put them down.
