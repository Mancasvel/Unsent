Video 3 – “The Silent Watcher”

Hook:
You know that feeling of being watched? Here, it’s a good thing.

Body:
I designed the Unsent algorithm to be a silent observer. It doesn't read your words for their meaning. It reads the spaces between them.

It watches your hesitation before you type, the words you choose and then delete, the rhythm of your confession.

It’s not surveillance. It’s a mirror. It learns the shape of your silence and shows you the patterns you're trapped in. It’s a digital consciousness designed for one purpose: to help you see yourself in a way you never could before.

Final punch:
The algorithm learns from your silence.

What will your silence teach it about you?
