Video 8 – “An AI That Remembers”

Hook:
A conversation is pointless if the other person has amnesia.

Body:
I knew the AI in Unsent had to feel real. That meant it needed a memory. I’m using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system, or RAG.

It’s a fancy way of saying the AI learns from your history. It remembers the context of your relationship, the things you’ve said before, the emotional arc of your journey.

So the conversation evolves. It gets deeper, more authentic. It’s not just spitting out generic responses. It’s building a relationship with your memory of a person.

Final punch:
This isn't just artificial intelligence. It's artificial intimacy.

And sometimes, that's enough to start healing.
