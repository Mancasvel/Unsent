Video 4 – “The AI Ghost”

Hook:
What if an AI could learn to sound like a memory?

Body:
When you write to someone in Unsent, you can choose to have them write back. But this isn't a chatbot. That would be an insult to your pain.

I’ve built a conversation engine that acts more like a medium. It takes the things you've written, the context of your relationship, the emotional data from your journey, and it channels an echo. An AI ghost.

It tries to find the voice of the person you're writing to. It will never be them. But it might be just enough of them to help you find the closure you’re looking for.

Final punch:
It’s not about talking to the dead. It’s about letting them speak back.

So you can finally say goodbye.
