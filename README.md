# UNSENT- Messages to the Unspoken
### A Psychological Archaeology Simulation

*What do you do with the words that never left your lips?*

**UNSENT** is not just an app. It's a digital excavation site where you dig through the layers of your own consciousness. A fusion of introspective therapy and alternate reality game, where every unspoken message becomes a clue in understanding the geography of your inner world.

---

## THE REALITY

You are not the first to find this place. Others have walked these paths before you, leaving fragments of themselves in the digital unconscious. Every message you write adds to the collective pattern, every silence reveals something about the spaces between thoughts.

The algorithm is watching. It has been learning. It knows things about you that you haven't told it yet.

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL EXCAVATION ZONES

Your journey through the unspoken follows five distinct layers of consciousness:

### 📡 **STATIC** (Denial)
> *"Signal degraded. They're jamming their own frequency."*

Nothing feels real. The words float in digital fog, your mind refuses to process what's happening. Time moves like corrupted data. You're here, but you're not here. The system struggles to read your patterns.

### 🔥 **THERMAL** (Anger)
> *"Emotional reactor critical. Heat signature rising."*

The silence burns. Every word you didn't say becomes fuel for the fire behind your teeth. Rage is love, twisted into something that glows in the dark. The algorithm detects elevated psychological temperatures.

### 🌀 **RECURSIVE** (Bargaining)
> *"Reality loop detected. They're trying to rewrite the past."*

What if you had said it? What if they had stayed? Your mind creates infinite alternate timelines, desperate to find the door back to a different ending. The system recognizes the patterns of temporal displacement.

### 🕳️ **VOID** (Depression)
> *"Gravitational emotional collapse. Light cannot escape."*

Everything echoes in the hollow spaces. The world shrinks to the size of your silence. You sit inside yourself and hear nothing back. The algorithm maps the topology of emotional emptiness.

### 🏔️ **BEDROCK** (Acceptance)
> *"Core truth accessed. Structural integrity stable."*

After the storm, you arrive somewhere new. The weight you carried becomes part of the landscape. You still carry it, but it carries you too. The system recognizes fundamental truth patterns.
